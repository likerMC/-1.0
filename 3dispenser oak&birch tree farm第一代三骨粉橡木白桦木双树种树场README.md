本树场是允许连点的 所以这次的树场效率我也已经统计 详情请见B站视频

this tree farm is spam approved, so the efficiency is already tested by me. Check it out on my bilibili video.


本树场的模式切换存在三种形态 不过这个故障是稳定的 故在使用的时候只需多点一下按钮 并不影响使用

the mode cahnging part of the tree farm includes a BUD(or QC?) positioning. However the bug is stable so you will just need to press the button once more, and it is not affecting the normal functioning of the machine. 


本树场的原木运输带有极小概率会发生故障 已经在故障的位置作出优化 在正常情况下完全不会影响机器运作 只不过想为树场设计外饰的伙伴可能要注意一下

the tree farm includes a very slight chance that the log transfering session may encounter a problem, and I have already made adjustment base on the problem. It will not affect the use of the tree farm in normal cases, just that the one who wants to make an outfit for the tree farm may have to be cautious.
